Design files for the onboard computer PCB and supporting boards with full history, keep repo private, to release designs use the hardware_design_releases repository, currently on V1.1.0

All wires should be concidered for outgassing characteristicsm, PTFE insulation has been selected as a standard insulation materal. Part Number 26 AWG: 5853 BK005
1 amp per conductor should be max. 

Space Grade PCB's should be constructed from rogers (low outgassing properties)

Pinout stm32cubeIDE file found in pinout directory, copy and move to external directory.
